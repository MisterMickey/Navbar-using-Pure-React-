map : This HOF is used to map all array value to our desired transformed value

filter : This HOF is used to filter all array elements on the basis of a given condition

reduce : it is used to derive a single value from all array elements, additionaly it requires two parameter, on is the callback function
        and the other one is the initial value of accumulator,
        This callback function further needs two parameters, acc(accumulator), and curr(current).
